# Covid 19 Anlysis for the UK

This project starts by downloading the latest UK data and doing some exploratory analysis - plotting log plots etc. Then we do some regression to calculate $r$ in order to estimate $R_0$ using an additional dataset. Finally we finish up with some SIR modelling to demonstrate the effects of the UK lockdown.

Please see the Jupyter Notebook for code and graphs.
